# Weather-App

## Description

My task for this week 6 assignment was to make a weather app that can run a 5 day forecast. once a city has been selected, a button appears so you can go back and see your local storage. Once your city is selected, data will be called back using openweather 5 day API. the documentation on the website was beneficial.
